# Self-Balancing-Robot
As the name suggests, the self-balancing robot is an automated vehicle that balances itself without any outside help or support. This project is a rather complex one as it involves using PID Control and involuted programming. 

Self-balancing robots are unique among all others, just because of their ability to balance on a given fixed position. Even if the robot is displaced from its position, it is programmed so that it again recovers its position.
