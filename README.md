# Self-Balancing-Robot
As the name suggests, the self-balancing robot is an automated vehicle that balances itself without any outside help or support. This project is a rather complex one as it involves using PID Control and involuted programming. 

Self-balancing robots are unique among all others, just because of their ability to balance on a given fixed position. Even if the robot is displaced from its position, it is programmed so that it again recovers its position.
## Componenets Required :
• arduino nano
• nemo17 stepper motor •a4988 stepper motor driver arduino module
• wheels • 12 volt lipo battery •hc05-bluetooth module
•gyroscope sensor
• angle brackets
• bolts ,nuts. • pin female, header pin, female jst pin
## Programming the Arduino
Step 1:Mechanical setup : Assembled the components according to the circuit diagram.

Step 2.Software Installation: Install the Arduino IDE on your computer if you haven't already.

Step 3.Upload the code:

1. Open the Self_Balancing_robot.ino file in the Arduino IDE.
2. Connect your Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.
3. Select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE (Tools > Board and Port).
4. Click the upload button (right arrow icon) in the IDE to compile and upload the code to your Arduino.


## Applications
1.Segway: Self-balancing unicycle, a self-powered unicycle that balances itself in three dimensions.

2.Monocycle Is The World’s First Self Balancing Bike: The Monocycle is a perfect city bike that can be used for short distance travels and can
be parked in the least available of spaces. Moreover, the bicycle comes with a strong electric motor to support the riders, so they need not push too hard to speed up the bike.

3.Electric self-balance bike scooter/with Remote switch/balance bike: it’s a self- balancing electric bike which balance itself on its two wheels.
